# Myfont

Flor de Ruina is born from the life that emerges in the crack, in the fissure. Its variants are a conceptual process that emulate the life cycle of a flower, therefore each glyph germinates, blooms, withers, and finally fissures. Designed as a tool to make visible the word that unsettles, questioning the automatic reading so prevalent in typographic tradition by proposing a system that slows down reading, pausing on form and meaning. It finds beauty in discomfort, designed to interrupt.
